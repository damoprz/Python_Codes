Damiens Python Codes for plotting from MURaM, SPARC and MANCHA

I am not very good at python. I am quitting IDL and moving to Python for post and pre production. Largely related to MHD simulations, with some spectral synthesis and radiative transfer. Much of this is learn by doing, so fixes, suggestions and constructive critism are welcome.
