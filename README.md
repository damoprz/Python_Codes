Damiens Python Codes for plotting from MURaM, SPARC and MANCHA

I am currently not very competent with python yet. However, I am trying to stop using IDL and move to Python for post and pre production. Mostly related to MHD simulations, with some spectral synthesis and radiative transfer. Much of this has been using a 'learn by doing' approach, so fixes, suggestions and constructive critism are welcome.
